signT.R: updated signT R function
signM.R: matrix version of SignT.R

imageoutput.RData: a dataframe writting results of averaged MAE and SD from 5 repetition,
                   across all combination of methods(CPT,nonparaM,softimpute,hardimpute), ranks(2,4,...,20), and missing rates(20,40,60,80).
