Lemma 7(Local complexity of $\Phi(r,s_1,s_2)$ and $\Phi(r)$) needs extra $\log n$-term.
Equation (71) should be changed to $\lesssim \sqrt{r(s_1+s_2)\log(1/x)}$
Correspondingly, Theorem 3.3 and 3.4 need to have $\log n$ term on the bound.
                 Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 need to have $(\log n)^2$ instead of $\log n$.
