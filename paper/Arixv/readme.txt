\bigcup_{\phi\in A_{s,k}} =>\bigcup_{(s,k)\in \mathbb{N}\times\matbb{N}}, where $\matbb{N}=\{1,2,...\}$.

\bigcup_{\phi\in A_s} =>\bigcup_{s\in \mathbb{N}}

3. Lemma 7(Local complexity of $\Phi(r,s_1,s_2)$ and $\Phi(r)$) needs extra $\log n$-term.
Equation (71) should be changed to $\lesssim \sqrt{r(s_1+s_2)\log(1/x)}$
Correspondingly, Theorem 3.3 and 3.4 need to have $\log n$ term on the bound.
                 Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 need to have $(\log n)^2$ instead of $\log n$.
                 Theorem A.1. needs $\log|\Omega|$ term.
